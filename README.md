Completed My End-to-End Data Analytics Project on **Heart Disease Prediction!** 🩺📊

I'm excited to share my latest project, where I analyzed a Heart Disease dataset to predict whether a person is at risk of heart disease based on medical attributes. This project involved Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Engineering, and Machine Learning Model Building to make accurate predictions.

🔍 Project Overview:

🏥 Objective: Predict heart disease based on key health factors like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.

📊 Dataset: Includes patient medical records with labeled outcomes.

🛠 Workflow:

✔️ Data Cleaning (Handling Missing Values, Scaling)

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis (Visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib)

✔️ Feature Engineering & Selection

✔️ Model Building (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

✔️ Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

📌 Key Insights:

✅ People with higher cholesterol levels showed an increased risk of heart disease.

✅ Individuals with a maximum heart rate (THALACH) above 140 bpm are significantly more likely to have heart disease.

✅ People experiencing chest pain types 1, 2, and 3 have a higher chance of heart disease compared to those with CP type 0.

✅ Logistic Regression performed well with an accuracy of 83%.





💡 Technologies Used:

🔹 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

🔹 Jupyter Notebook

This project enhanced my understanding of data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and model evaluation. Looking forward to working on more exciting projects!
